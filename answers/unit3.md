# Week 4

## Synthesis Questions

### The Neuron
- Recall the main parts of a neuron and list their functions
  - **Dendrites** - receive signals from other neurons
  - **Cell body** - contains the nucleus and other organelles
  - **Axon** - carries signals away from the cell body
  - **Axon terminal** - releases neurotransmitters into the synapse
  - **Myelin sheath** - a insulation layer of tissue
- An action potential travels from the direction of the **dendrites** along the **axon** before reaching the **axon terminal**.


### The Brain
- What distinguishes the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain?
  - The forebrain is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as memory and language.
  - The midbrain is the middle part of the brain and is responsible for motor control and visual processing.
  - The hindbrain is the smallest part of the brain and is responsible for basic functions such as breathing and heart rate.
- What are several parts of the midbrain and what are their functions?
  - Pons - responsible for breathing and sleep-wake cycle
  - Medulla oblongata - responsible for heartbeat and blood pressure

### Neuroanatomy
- What are the four major parts of the brain?
  - The frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes
- Summarize the main functions of each of the four major components above, or jot down some details about each.
  - Frontal lobe - responsible for motor control, language, and memory
  - Parietal lobe - responsible for sensory processing
  - Occipital lobe - responsible for visual processing
  - Temporal lobe - responsible for auditory processing
- What is a receptive field?
  - Receptive fields are the areas of the visual field that a neuron responds to
- Describe characteristics of a cortical area. Find your favorite cortical area described in the lecture and describe some things that make it interesting.
  - Regions of the cerebral cortex that are responsible for specific functions
