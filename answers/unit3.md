# Week 5

## Synthesis Questions
-   In what direction do gradients flow (with regards to loss)?
	- In the direction of steepest increase in the loss function
-   How do gradients flow through addition? How do they flow through the ReLU function?
	- For addition, the gradient is passed on to all input branches without any modification
	- For ReLU, the gradient is passed on if it is greater than 0 and otherwise a gradient of 0 is passed on
-   What was your best loss for the test dataset?
-   Was there something that stood out to you? Something that confused you?
-   What's one resource that was helpful (suggested or found on your own)?
